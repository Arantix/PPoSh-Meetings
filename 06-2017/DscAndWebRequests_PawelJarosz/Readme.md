## Thank you all for joining second Polish PowerShell user group meeting!

On the first meeting I have highlited what is DSC, how to install it and what are the capabilities.

I wanted to continue with the subject of DSC and focus on aspects like HA cluster for HTTPS pull server, building advanced pull servers on windows core.

Unfortunately HA for DSC using ARR is no longer supported, hence I kind of gave up on this subject.

We may go back to DSC but being honest there is not so bit interest being honest for this topic at the moment.

All of this will be also documented on this PPOSH GitHub and my private blog https://paweljarosz.wordpress.com
